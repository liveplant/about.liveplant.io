# Robot 

## New Member: Zach Stokes

Zach Stokes (@DeftxPunk) has joined the project! Why is this so exciting? He
has direct experience putting together an IoT hydroponics robot! 

[Check out the kickstarter page for "The Root".](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/57013250/the-root-a-self-contained-solar-powered-plant-grow)

We look forward to see him dropping some knowledge on us and getting the ball
rolling over on [the robot repo](https://github.com/liveplant/liveplant-bot).

# Server Stuff

## Housekeeping 

Took care of some housekeeping on [liveplant server](https://github.com/liveplant/liveplant-server). 

- [Added cors](https://github.com/liveplant/liveplant-server/issues/14)
- [Added support for OPTIONS](https://github.com/liveplant/liveplant-server/issues/14)

## 1.0.0 milestone

I went ahead and set up a milestone for issues that are direct action items: [1.0.0 milestone](https://github.com/liveplant/liveplant-server/milestones/1.0.0).

Issues that have been added to this 1.0.0 milestone can be considered ready to
be implemented and are blocking the project completion. Feel free to claim an
issue and make it your own.

# Client 

Nothing notable to report. Check the [existing open issues](https://github.com/liveplant/liveplant.io/issues).

Discussion about the strategy going forward is happening
[here](https://github.com/liveplant/liveplant.io/issues/10) and
[here](https://github.com/liveplant/liveplant.io/issues/1). Input is needed.
